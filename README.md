This repo contains various scripts that I've found handy at times and other
assorted cruft that has collected in ~/bin on various unix boxen over the
years.  It's mainly for my own use but feel free to snoop around.

Noteworthy items:

ljlcd - Change "READY" message on the LCD display a networked HP LaserJet. Requires bash, netcat.

	ljlcd 10.0.1.2 "Green Toner Low"
